  "### Input: So this is a hard, like, should I be worried?\n### Output: \"Yeah, you know what? It sounds from what you're telling me, it sounds like you have shortness of breath on exertion, and it sounds like you have a cough with still producing some phlegm. It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now, but of course we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff. But right now, I'm thinking it could be something called COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder because of your smoking history. Uhm, so we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest x-ray, and I we'll try to go from there. If it is COPD we'll likely put you on a, like a puffer for that. A like a lot a short or long acting beta agonist, that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is. How does that sound?\"<|endoftext|>",
  "### Input: Sounds great, doc. Thanks a million.\n### Output: \"Alright, great thank you.\"<|endoftext|>"
