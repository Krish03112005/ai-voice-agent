      "doctor: OK for sure so um we will run some investigations and likely get a chest X Ray because it's been a couple of months that these symptoms have been going on for. But I think it could be related to your smoking and most likely um Bronc, chronic bronchitis, but we can definitely will be looking into this, and then also with possibly some pulmonary function tests as well."

      "patient: Um no, that, I was just worried about uh Covid.",
      "doctor: Yeah, so that's definitely top on the list right now for things that we have to rule you out for. Um so we'll take a swab today, we'll send it off um for those PCR results, you should hear back in 24 to 48 hours. Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods. Uh but if your symptoms get worse, like you're running a really high fever, um you're having neurological symptoms like you know seizures or fainting spells, um or if you're having difficulty breathing, um you should come back to the ER. So how does that sound?",
      "patient: Yeah, it's really informative. Thank you.",
      "doctor: Alright, take care."

      "doctor: Uhm, when did the shortness of breath start?",
      "patient: So, this winter specifically, like we haven't been too active because of Covid this year, we've just been staying in the house all last year, but with the snow, I'd be shovelling snow whenever it fell and before I could be able to like 2 years ago be able to clear the driveway, no problem, but now even after half the driveway I've noticed I'm getting consisntely out of breath, I've got this nasty cough and it's prompted my wife to get me to call in, she's a little bit worried.",
      "doctor: So it's mostly on exertion, it doesn't happen at rest, is that correct?",
      "patient: Being out of breath? No, no.",
      "doctor: No, OK, ok. And has this ever happened to you before?",

Just couldn't do it.",
      "doctor: Uhm, and how did you manage like how, how was that treated at that time and how did you get better?",
      "patient: Oh, I didn't do any. I just attributed to being, I don't know, out of shape a little bit and I worked as a mechanic when I was younger. I was pretty active, but ever since retiring thought I'd keep up, at least my stamina won't go away that quickly, but chalked it up to being out of shape and went home.",

      "patient: Yeah.",
      "doctor: OK, any coughing with that?",

      "patient: Uh, yellow, sometimes a little brown.",
      "doctor: OK, and when did that start?",

      "doctor: OK, any blood that you bring up?",
      "patient: Not that I've noticed, like bright red? No, nothing like that.",
      "doctor: OK. Any wheeziness?",

      "doctor: Uhm, at rest or?",
      "patient: Nothing, nothing when I'm not moving.",
      "doctor: OK, so the chest pain, when did that start?",
      "patient: First noticed it this winter on the driveway but it wasn't like I know what they say about a heart attack, supposed to like, the crushing pain in your chest that moves up your neck. Nothing like that. It's like my lungs, my throat. Like you're really, really out of breath, you know?",
      "doctor: OK, so you're attributing it mostly to your shortness of breath then?",
      "patient: I think so. I really hope this is my heart. I've never had a heart attack.",
      "doctor: Yeah. Where in your chest is this chest pain happening like is it central? Is it more towards the left, towards the right?",

      "patient: You know I got these weird things on my head. I think mainly because of the sun. Like these brown patches, but that wouldn't be a rash, would it?",
      "doctor: I'd have to examine that closer. If you think it's associated with the sun, it could be something like seborrheic keratosis, but I'd have to see what they look like so we can take a look at that later, if that's OK. And so any changes in your vision or hearing?",
      "patient: No.",

      "doctor: No, OK. Any, OK, so you mentioned a family history of your brother having congenital heart disease. Any other heart diseases that run in the family?",
      "patient: Congenital. What's that mean?",
      "doctor: Like something that you're born with.",
      "patient: No, I don't think he's ever born thing he had a couple of heart attacks.",
      "doctor: Oh heart attacks. OK sorry I must have misinterpreted that. How old was he when he had his first heart attack?",
      "patient: He's older me by five years, but he had the first one when he was younger than I am now. Like 62 was the first one, another one at 65.",
      "doctor: OK. Uhm, did, is he, did they ever find a cause for his heart attack? Is he a healthy person?",
      "patient: Healthy, he's healthy. I you know I wouldn't call him too healthy of a guy either. He's a hard liver, let's call him that. I have why it happened, I think, obviously it's his diet man. He's like a hog. Steaks, butter, bacon I'm  assuming that's what did him in.",
      "doctor: Oh yikes, OK. OK, uh any other heart conditions that run in the family or other members of the family experiencing heart attacks?",
      "patient: Yep, dad died young from a high heart attack. He was, he died younger than I am now. He passed away at 66.",
      "doctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.",
      "patient: Oh it's been years now. It is what it is. His grandmother had a stroke. High blood pressure on my mom side. High cholesterol on my mom side too. But yeah, awful heart attacks on my father side of the family.",
      "doctor: OK. Any other lung, any lung conditions that run in the family?",
      "patient: None that come to mind.",
      "doctor: OK and do you smoke?",
      "patient: Yeah, yeah I smoke.",
      "doctor: OK, how much do you smoke?",
      "patient: I cut it back, about half a pack a day for the last two years now.",
      "doctor: OK and before that?",
      "patient: I was pretty much a pack a day. Maybe, well, when it was bad, 2 packs a day, but I've been smoking yeah, since about, when do they start working at the shop, like 17, everyone there smokes.",
      "doctor: Oh OK Wow yeah well then but it's good that you cut down, that's good. Do you, do any other recreational drugs like marijuana, cocaine, heroin, anything?",
      "patient: I'll smoke weed at the shop every Friday, but I'm not huge fan of it to be honest.",
      "doctor: OK. And how much do you smoke every Friday?",
      "patient: Both are about four joints, seven people, so I don't know what that is. Half a gram?",
      "doctor: Half a joint? OK, yeah. OK, and do you drink?",
      "patient: Oh yeah.",
      "doctor: How much do you drink?",
      "patient: See, Christmas was about the last time I went out like a beer or two. Uhm, weekends but when families in town will we'll go whole hog. I'll drink maybe 20 beer.",
      "doctor: Oh OK, OK. And yeah you should, have you thought about cutting that down?",
      "patient: You gotta keep up with the family, you know, you can't let them embarrass you like that.",
      "doctor: Let's, I understand that, but also you know, it's important to take care of your health and slow and steady wins the race, right?",
      "patient: I'll keep that in mind, doc, I'll keep that in mind.",
      "doctor: Yeah, and how's your diet?",
      "patient: Been pretty good. The wife's been on a, on a health food craze last five years. Vegetables, I don't know, I eat whatever she cooks, basically.",
      "doctor: OK. Uhm that's good, and in terms of exercise, do you get to move around?",
      "patient: I used to be pretty active. I used to bike around, but 'cause of Covid I've just been indoors all this time. So no, not much.",
      "doctor: OK. OK, well it's good to go out for a walk once in awhile. I think that's allowed during Covid as long as you're being safe. And who do you live with at home?",
      "patient: I live with my wife.",
      "doctor: OK, any children?",
      "patient: Yeah, I've got three kids, one for my first marriage, two with the Mrs. right now.",
      "doctor: OK, and do you get to see them often?",
      "patient: Yeah, daughter lives in town and get to see her and grand kid a bit, the other boy works in Fort Mac and my oldest son, he's out east.",
      "doctor: OK, OK, and have you had any contact with people who've been sick recently?",
      "patient: No, we've been keeping entirely to ourselves. You can get our groceries ordered to the house.",
      "doctor: OK. And how about travel? Any recent travel?",
      "patient: No.",
      "doctor: No, OK. Uhm, and then lastly, just wanted to ask you because you have been smoking for a long time, have you ever been diagnosed with something called COPD?",
      "patient: Doesn't ring a bell.",
      "doctor: No, OK. Have you ever had any pulmonary function tests or chest x-rays done in the past?",
      "patient: Chest x-ray, I think they did a chest x-ray after the car crash.",
      "doctor: OK.",
      "patient: But I can't think of getting one recently, no.",
      "doctor: OK. Alright well those are all the questions that I had for you. Did you have any questions for me?",
      "patient: So this is a hard, like, should I be worried?",
      "doctor: Yeah, you know what? It sounds from what you're telling me, it sounds like you have shortness of breath on exertion, and it sounds like you have a cough with still producing some phlegm. It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now, but of course we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff. But right now, I'm thinking it could be something called COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder because of your smoking history. Uhm, so we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest x-ray, and I we'll try to go from there. If it is COPD we'll likely put you on a, like a puffer for that. A like a lot a short or long acting beta agonist, that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is. How does that sound?",
      "patient: Sounds great, doc. Thanks a million.",
      "doctor: Alright, great thank you."
